You hear panicked voices and realise you are in some sort of container.

The language is illegible. The pulse of a heartbeat monitor begins to echo in
your mind, it's pace increasing rapidly. You shake uncontrollably. An intense
pain hits your temple, and your skull feels like it will explode. Sparks begins
to enter your vision.

"Let it go." The voice echoes in your head.

    Obeying the voice, the sparks growing more volatile before a giant flash
    of light fills your eyes. You feel your body fling itself from its bonds
    and the floor hits you a moment later. Vision spinning, everything
    fades to black.

    You wake up on the floor in the midst of an explosion. Familiar faces look upon
    you with horror as you lift your head and gaze around. Babbling and panic
    erupts.

    You pull yourself to your feet.

  #Contain it
    *set physique +1
    Steeling yourself, your teeth grind together painfully. You close your eyes
    and try to contain the feeling. A feeling of power surges through you and
    your restraints crumbles as you pull your hands free.

    Placing both hands on the wall of the container, you push hard. The
    container gives way with no resistance causing you to stumble as a large
    metal piece flies forward, hitting the floor with force.
